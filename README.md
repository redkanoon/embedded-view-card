# üß© Embedded View Card for Home Assistant

The **Embedded View Card** allows you to embed another Lovelace view directly into a card inside your current dashboard ‚Äì or even across dashboards.  
It‚Äôs perfect for modular layouts, reusable components, and dynamic navigation.

---

## üí° Why this card?
Managing complex dashboards with many pages or modular views can become difficult and repetitive.  
This card was built to make it easier to design reusable view components that can be visually customized and referenced from anywhere.

Instead of copying entire layouts into every view, you can now embed them once and reuse them multiple times.  
Compared to using iframes, this approach is faster, more integrated, and avoids the delay of loading a separate web page.

This card was built to feel like a native part of Home Assistant ‚Äì rendering views directly, without hacks or reloads.

---

## ‚ö° Features

- Embed any view from the **current or another dashboard**
- **Static mode**: pick dashboard + view directly
- **Dynamic mode**: use an entity (`input_text`) whose state is `dashboard/view`
- Loop guard to prevent self-embedding
- Optionally wrap content in `ha-card`
- **Bleed mode**: remove default padding with adjustable margins
- Editor UI with localized labels and previews
- Compatible with HACS for easy updates

## üñ•Ô∏è Editor Support

- Dropdown selection of dashboards and views
- Dynamic entity preview and format hints
- Localized labels (EN, DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, PL, ‚Ä¶)
- Warning note about recursive loop detection (not yet supported)

---

## üß™ Developer Notes

- Uses internal components like `hui-root` and `hui-view`  
  *(subject to change by Home Assistant core)*
- Internal caching of WS configs for faster reloads
- Smarter re-rendering (only when dashboard/view changes)
- Gracefully shows error messages when view is not found or misconfigured

## üöÄ Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests and suggestions.  
Ideas for improvement:

- Add safe recursive loop detection
- Add mode "internal" where the embedded view could be changed with actions
